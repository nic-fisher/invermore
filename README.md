# Avoid The Cleaning

This is a one player game where the aim of the game is to avoid Georgie (my wife) and the gumption while collecting as many burgers has possible. There are 
three levels to select from.

This isn't hosted anywhere but it can be. There's a `./build.sh` script which will compile all the necessary files for release.

To run this locally:
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

This is how the game looks:
